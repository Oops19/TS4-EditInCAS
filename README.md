# Edit random Sims and Outfits in CAS
This funky mod allows to pick 1-8 sims and to edit their standard outfits in CAS.

It is not meant to edit Bathing, Situation, Career, Special, Towel, Fashion and/or Batuu outfits.
I suggest to create these outfits as Everyday 3-5, Swimming 3-5, etc. and to use [Copy Outfits](https://github.com/Oops19/TS4-CopyOutfits) to transfer them.

It ignores occults, at least nothing has been added to support them.

## Usage
Enable cheat menus (unless already enabled). Shift-Click on a sim and select 'Modify Sims in CAS.
Or open the cheat console with Shift+Ctrl+C and enter the cheat command `o19.eicas` or `o19.edit_in_cas` to open the sim picker and to enter CAS.

In CAS the outfits can be modified and new outfits can be added.
Also makeup, hats, etc. can be modified

## Issues
When cloning sims to a new household this works properly within the game.
Anyhow the UI (CAS) is not always updated properly.  

### Things to avoid in CAS:
* Add, import and/or delete sims (new, replaced and/or removed sims are ignored)
* Remove outfits (they will not be removed from the original sim)
* Modify age (except in the range Teen - Elder)
* Add, remove or modify occults.

### Transferred attributes
The code used is from Copy Outfits, so it should work fine and support also filtering in the future.
While the copy process itself works fine, displaying the copied data in CAS may fail.

Currently only 'Outfits' are copied back from CAS to the sim.
There is no way to detect which values have been replaced by TS4 with random values.
* All Outfits (+)
* Base Attributes (?)
  * Age (+)
  * Gender (+)
  * Extended Species (?)
* Physical Attributes (?)
  * Facial Attributes (+)
    * Sculpts (+)
    * Face Modifiers (+)
    * Body Modifiers (+)
  * Physique (-)
  * Voice Pitch (+)
  * Voice Actor (+)
  * Voice Effect (+)
  * Skin Tone (+)
  * Skin Tone Value Shift (+)
  * Flags (?)
  * Pelt Layers (?)
  * Extended Species (?)
  * Base Trait IDs (?)
  * Genetic Data (?)
    * Genetic Data (?)
    * Genetic Data B (?)
* Walk Styles (+)
* Traits (?)
* Gender & Pregnancy settings (?)
* Name (+)
* Pronouns (?)
* Household Relationship (-)

* `-` replaced by random values in CAS
* `+` seem to work fine every time
* `?` to be tested

### Important
After exiting CAS answer the 'Save Game?' question with 'Just Switch to Household'.
In case you click 'Cancel' manually change to the previously played household to finish the outfit edit.

If you don't switch to the previously played household TS4 will have a new household with the sims selected and edited before.
'Cancel' is a valid choice to add a new household and to keep the new household.
To keep the household change it to played households in CAS and then save and exit the game.
Without exiting the game it may still be deleted when switching back to the previously played household.

## Removal of the mod
Ths mod installation with unzip writes to a few directories.
To remove this mod and all related files locate the files and folders and remove them:
* `The Sims 4/Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.*`
* `The Sims 4/mod_data/_o19_/$mod_name/`
* `The Sims 4/mod_documentation/_o19_/$mod_name/`
* `The Sims 4/mod_sources/_o19_/$mod_name/`

To remove all of my mods locate these folders and remove them:
* `The Sims 4/Mods/_o19_/`
* `The Sims 4/mod_data/_o19_/`
* `The Sims 4/mod_documentation/_o19_/`
* `The Sims 4/mod_sources/_o19_/`
 
## Installation
* Locate the localized `The Sims 4` folder which contains the `Mods` folder.
* Extract the ZIP file into this `The Sims 4` folder.
* It will create the directories/files `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.ts4script`, `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.package`, `mod_data/$mod_name/*` and/or `mod_documentation/$mod_name/*` and/or `mod_sources/$mod_name/*`
* CAS and build-buy UGC without scripts will create `Mods/o19/$mod_name.package`.
* `mod_logs/$mod_name.txt` will be created as soon as data is logged.
* `mod_documentation/$mod_name/` and/or `mod_sources/$mod_name/` are not required and can be deleted.

### Manual Installation
If you don't want to extract the ZIP file into `The Sims 4` folder you might want to read this.
You can extract the ZIP file to a temporary directory and copy the folders manually.
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_data` are usually required and should be extracted to `The Sims 4/mod_data`.
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_documentation` are for you to read it. They are not needed to use this mod.
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_sources` are not needed to use this mod.
* The `Mods/_o19_/*.ts4script` files can be stored in a random folder within `Mods` or directly in `Mods`. I highly recommend to store it in `_o19_` so you know who created it.

## Troubleshooting
When installed properly this is not necessary at all.
For manual installations check these things and make sure each question can be answered with 'yes'.
* Does 'The Sims 4' (localized to Die Sims 4, Les Sims 4, Los Sims 4, The Sims 4, ...) exist?
  * Does `The Sims 4` contain the folder `Mods`?
    * Does `Mods` contain the folder `_o19_`? 
      * Does `_19_` contain `ts4lib.ts4script` and `ts4lib.package` files?
      * Does `_19_` contain `{mod_name}.ts4script` and/or `{mod_name}.package` files?
  * Does `The Sims 4` contain the folder `mod_data`?
    * Does `mod_data` contain the folder `{mod_name}`?
      * Does `{mod_name}` contain files or folders?
  * Does `The Sims 4` contain the `mod_logs` ?
    * Does `mod_logs` contain the file `Sims4CommunityLib_*_Messages.txt`?
    * Does `mod_logs` contain the file `TS4-Library_*_Messages.txt`?
      * Is this the most recent version or can it be updated?
    * Does `mod_logs` contain the file `{mod_name}_*_Messages.txt`?
      * Is this the most recent version or can it be updated?
  * Doesn't `The Sims 4` contain the file(s) `last_exception.txt`  and/or `last_exception*.txt` ?
* Share the `The Sims 4/mod_logs/Sims4CommunityLib_*_Messages.txt` and `The Sims 4/mod_logs/{mod_name}_*_Messages.txt`  file.
